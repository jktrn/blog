### Intro

I was recently invited by the academic team "DN" (the name, surprisingly, has no inappropriate connotation) to compete in Mentor High School's second CTF iteration, MHSCTF 2023. Although the competition ran for 15 days, we maxed out their 11 challenges in just under 16 hours (ignoring solve resets). These four writeups are part of the verification process which comes with prize-receiving â€” enjoy!

    I've just had the most brilliant idea ðŸ˜® I want to write a program that takes all the students and how much they like each other to pair them up so I can maximize the total love in the classroom! Of course, when I say "I," I really mean... "you" ;)  
    Notes: **[SEE BELOW]**  
    `nc 0.cloud.chals.io 22304`
{% endchallenge %}

Here are the notes the author provided alongside the challenge description, abridged for brevity:

- The connection times out after 60 seconds, and there will be 3 iterations
- The input will be given in $N$ lines where $N$ is the number of students. The first line represents the zeroth student, the second line represents the first student, and so on ($50 < N < 100$, $N \pmod 2 = 0$)
- Each line of input consists of $N - 1$ integers $R$ (ranged $0 < R < 100$, inclusive) that represent that student's rating of everybody but themselves
- Determine the pairings that maximize the students' ratings for each other
    - **Example**: If Student 1 -> Student 7 = 98 and Student 7 -> Student 1 = 87, and Students 1 and 7 are paired, the "score" of this pairing would be $98 + 87 = 185$
- The output should list all maximized pairs (including duplicates; order of the pairs does not matter)
    - **Example**: If Student 0 -> Student 3, Student 1 -> Student 2, and Student 4 -> Student 5, the desired output is: `0,3;1,2;2,1;3,0;4,5;5,4`
- The connection will close if the output is incorrect, and reiterate if correct

Let's see some sample input from the server:

{% ccb lang:py gutter1:1-4 caption:matchmaker.py %}
from pwn import *

p = remote('0.cloud.chals.io', 22304)
print(r.recvuntilS(b'> '))
{% endccb %}

SKIP_LINE(...)
{% endccb %}

We can do a bit of analysis on what we've received so far.

The line `86 60 67...` can be translated into something along the lines of:
- Student 0 -> Student 1 = 86
- Student 0 -> Student 2 = 60
- Student 0 -> Student 3 = 67

Let's do the same thing for the second line, `76 0 74...`:
- Student 1 -> Student 0 = 76
- Student 1 -> Student 2 = 0
- Student 1 -> Student 3 = 74

Notice how the student will always skip their own index, which aligns with the author's notes detailing how the integers "represent the students ratings of everybody but themselves." Let's crack on with the actual algorithm which will be used for solving this!

### The Blossom Algorithm

This challenge is a classic example of a concept called "maximum weight matching", which is extraordinarily fundamental in the graph theory subdiscipline in discrete mathematics.

    The first thing I want to give everyone is chocolate, of course. I found this wonderful company that sells the most exquisite chocolates, but I heard that they sell a super special secret valentine chocolate that's hidden somewhere on their website. Here's the website, do you think you can find it for me?

    Passing secret notes? That practically *screams* Valentine's Day to me! So, I've devised a super-secure way to encrypt a message so you can send it to that special someone! I used my program to encrypt a Valentine just for you! The only thing is... I don't remember the key. Ah, whatever! Here you go: `V4m\GDMHaDM3WKy6tACXaEuXumQgtJufGEyXTAtIuDm5GEHS`  
    The `valentine{...}` wrapper is included in the encrypted text.
