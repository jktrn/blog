## What is a CTF?

In cybersecurity, capture-the-flag competitions (CTFs) are a typically team-based activity in which players will partake in various challenges to accrue points and secure positions on a leaderboard. There are two signature types of CTFs:

- **Jeopardy**: Competition organizers design challenges in several distinct categories: web exploitation, forensics, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, cryptography, etc. Challenges - typically in the format of a file or website - are solved by discovering a text-based "flag" planted within them, in the format `flag{th15_i5_a_f1ag}`. *(This is the type I participate in!)*
- **Attack-Defense**: Teams are given a remote service, device, or host to protect whilst an enemy team attempts to exploit its processes to gain access.

## What do these categories entail?

- **üí• Binary Exploitation/`binary/pwn`**: These challenges involve exploiting Linux executables hosted on servers to obtain flags, often through deprecated/vulnerable C-language functions that the executable uses. Requires an understanding of assembly code, the stack data structure, and exploit-writing (via Python and [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/)).
- **üë©‚Äçüíª Cryptography/`crypto`**: These challenges consist of identifying and decoding provided ciphertexts, often in both old/obscure encryption methods (i.e. Vigenere, Pigpen, Caesar) and more contemporary ones ([RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)), [Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange), and [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher) cryptosystems).
- **üîç Forensics**: These challenges involve analysis of files ‚Äî often [packet captures](https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/pcap), images (steganography), operating system captures, audio snippets. Files can occasionally be partially/fully corrupt, or obfuscated in an seemingly unrecoverable manner.
- **üîÉ Reverse Engineering/`rev`**: These challenges involve attempting to reverse engineer a compiled program to identify and exploit its vulnerabilities. Similar to `pwn`, this category requires knowledge of the C programming language, assembly code, and various open-source software to analyze/decompile the provided executables (i.e. [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/), [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/))
- **üåê Web Exploitation/`web`**: These challenges involve finding secrets and/or exploiting vulnerabilities in a website/web application. This can range from finding a comment in its `index.html` to SQL/command injection.

## What team do play with?

I mainly play with **[Project Sekai](https://sekai.team/)**, but I (think) I'm free to join teams in competitions they're not playing in. Feel free to DM to confirm!

## I want to start, but I don't know where?

Although the field may seem extremely overwhelming and difficult to get into, there are a seemingly endless amount of resources available on the internet to get you up to spec with prerequisite knowledge:

- **[picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/resources)**: A CTF run by Carnegie Mellon University, providing handy learning guides for each CTF category, "Primer" documentation, and the `picoGym`, which contains every challenge from its previous annual competitions.
- **[CTF101](https://ctf101.org/)**: Extremely handy documentation/wiki for common CTF practices and challenges per-category.
- **[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)**: A "wargame" year-round CTF with hundreds of level-based challenges to help practice security concepts.
- **[CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/)**: Serves as a "hub" for the global CTF community, with information regarding upcoming competitions, leaderboards, writeups (how-to-solve walkthroughs), and more!
